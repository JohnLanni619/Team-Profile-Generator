# Team-Profile-Generator  

Starter code for this assignment was provided by our class instructor, Kevin Ferguson. The code provided was included in my original commit.

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Key Points
1. Created and passed tests for Employee, Engineer, Intern, and Manager classes.
2. Used inquirer to accept command line input from user.
3. Command line allows user to add and customize team members in project.
4. User is able to choose between three employee types and customize data for each.
5. When the user is finished adding in their team, an HTML file is generated containing all relevant information.
